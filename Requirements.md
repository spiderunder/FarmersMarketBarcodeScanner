Requirements:

Farmers must be able to log in with an arbitrary e-mail of their choosing into a portal. All farmers already have a numeric code associated with them called their Farm ID.

in that portal, farmers can scan barcodes with their phone or computer, these barcodes correspond to one of two coupons (at this time, this may change later):
* New York Fresh
* Health Bucks -  Health Bucks is prefixed with HB in their serial number

The farmers shall select the coupon type before beginning scanning, and scan only that coupon type during the scanning session. They should get an error or be otherwise notified if a re-scan occurs of a repeated barcode. Each scan should complete automatically and give an audio or visual cue when the scan has occurred. This means it should not require a manual button press each time.

these barcodes can be bulk-submitted into the system, and a photo which captured the barcode must be preserved so that they can be audited if needed.

Once uploaded, the farmers should be able to submit all of their coupons to the administrator, and see it marked as 'submitted' when they check their information panel.

The administrator shall be able to log in and see all submitted coupons, and download the data from the account. This shall be a report that shows the count of coupons submitted by a vendor for each coupon type, and a list of the serial numbers of the coupons. This is the explicit format requested:

Sheet one: Column A: Farm name Column B: Farm ID # Column C: Coupon count
Sheet two: Column A: row 1: Smallest Farm ID# Row 2: Coupon Count Row Three and beyond: Serial #s scanned
Sheet three: Column A: All serial #s Column B: Farm ID #
